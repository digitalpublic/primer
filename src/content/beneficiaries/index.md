Your project exists to help someone&mdash;a group of people, your members, residents of a neighborhood or city, patients, the public&mdash;improve their lives. 

We borrow from legal language and call these people beneficiaries. That is, people who you intend to benefit from your project, who may not all be fully involved running the day-to-day operations of the project.

Of course, your project involves more than just beneficiaries. It involves an ecosystem of different stakeholders, both within and outside your organization: from individual departments and partner organizations to third-party vendors, academic researchers, and government regulators. 

Each of these stakeholders has something to lose or gain from your project, and their interests may not always align with yours, or your beneficiaries'. Good projects account for thisâ€”with agreements to ensure responsibility, with documented internal practices to comply with regulations, with participation from beneficiaries to ensure their interests are being looked after. Each project is different, and each project will need to account for this differently. 

To build the best possible network of relationships for your project, you'll need to understand and adapt to the ecosystem of stakeholders that your project lives in. The exercise on the next page will help you do just that.
