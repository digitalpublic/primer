title: Who benefits from your project?
layout: exercise.hbs
exercise: beneficiaries
---
The project exists for a reason, but it also exists to benefit someone. List the project's beneficiaries: people, organizations, or classes the project's activities are intended to benefit. Beneficiaries could (but do not have to) include the public, specific patients, and project members. You can list classes of beneficiaries. Rank beneficiaries in order of importance--in other words, if there is a conflict of interest between two beneficiaries, whose interests should be prioritized. Try to avoid ties, but you may include them if you must.

Separately, list other parties who are or may be involved in the project (stakeholders). These stakeholders may be internal (e.g. membership; an organizational department; management) or external (e.g., vendors). Be as specific as possible: you can list classes of stakeholders (e.g., "practitioners in 100 hospitals in U.S. and Canada"), but separate the classes if there is a meaningful difference in how class members participate in or relate to the project. 

For each stakeholder, list:
* 	What they provide to the project (e.g., data, assets, services)
* 	What benefits they receive or could potentially receive from their involvement in the project.
* 	Whether those benefits are desirable, undesirable (e.g., a service provider builds a machine learning model off a dataset they store and monetizes it outside the project), or neutral.
