If you've been following along with the exercises, you've done quite a lot so far. You've described what your project is for and what it does. You've decided who should benefit from the project, and who else has a stake in it. And you've identified the project's assets: the data, code, and materials that make the project go.

Now, you'll need to decide who is responsible for the project.

On a basic level, this is probably a familiar task. Someone has to be responsible for executing each of the activities you described earlier, and someone needs to take ownership over the assets that the project uses or creates. Many of these activities and assets probably have owners already. Finally, the project may (or may not) have some sort of overall management structure, such as an executive director and a board.

But this exercise is more than just about assigning roles. At a deeper level, you're building a sense of responsibility between your team and the people you mean to help. And although we can help you build a management structure, ensuring that that management is accountable and trustworthy is ultimately up to you. 

So, as you work through this next step, have the bigger picture in mind. Are the managers you've picked the right ones? What do they need to do their jobs better, whether skills or staff or resources? What happens if a stakeholder can no longer execute an activity, or manage an asset?
