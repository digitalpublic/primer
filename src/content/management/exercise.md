*This exercise will prompt users to identify responsible decision-makers for their project. A prose description of the exercise follows. It will be converted to an interactive soon.*

Describe the management of the project.

First, describe who is responsible for the project's operation and oversight. If this project were a standalone organization, that might be the organization's CEO and its board, respectively. This may not be the only structure: responsibility may be split between multiple stakeholders, and there may be additional layers of oversight.

Second, for each activity, list the stakeholder or stakeholders who are responsible for executing the activity. If there are multiple stakeholders responsible for the activity, use these roles: 
* Day-to-day
* Oversight / escalation
* Support / service provider
* Other

Finally, for each asset, list the stakeholder or stakeholders who are responsible for producing, managing, storing, and controlling access to the asset (where relevant). If additional stakeholders may face liabilities related to that asset (for instance, due to regulatory risks), list them separately.
