Let's start at the beginning, with a simple question: what is the purpose of your data project?

That is, why are you doing this project? Why have you chosen to spend your limited time and resources on it, instead of on something else? What do you hope to accomplish with the project? How will you know if you're accomplishing it?

A purpose gives a project direction, and animates the rest of the decisions that you'll make. It should act as a bridge between your organization's mission and the activities you pursue under the project.

Don't skip this part. It may feel obvious or trivial. You may think that everyone in your organization has the same clear idea in their heads of what this project is for, and how you'll go about doing it. And that might be true. But it might not be. Our brains are really good at assuming we have a complete picture in our heads, and ignoring the fact that we're missing key details. Writing down your project's purpose, and the enabling objectives and activities, can help surface those missing details, and make sure your project's logic is airtight. It also ensures that everyone working on the project has a common goal in mind when building technology, finding partners, and deciding what to do next. 

The last reason for writing your project's purpose down? You might not be running it forever. You could get promoted, or leave, or your team could change. Writing down your project's purpose can help your successors take up the project and ensure it remains on course.
