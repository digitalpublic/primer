We began by congratulating you for embarking on a project of building thoughtful data governance. If you’ve made it this far, then you’ve taken an important next step: thinking through the core pieces of effective data governance for your organization or project. 

Now, what’s next?
 
Much remains to be done. Good data governance is hard. Making it real will require detailed information gathering, reflection on organizational capacities, recasting of stakeholder relationships, and the weighing of organizational risks. Put another way, it takes time, resources, and a commitment to changing how your organization does what it does.
 
To make this hard work a little easier, we might suggest the following next steps:
 
1. **Readiness reflection.** This primer has aimed to provide you with a clearer articulation of both your core values and your readiness to implement a data governance system.
 
Now that you’ve completed the primer, you can use the results to reflect on your organization or project. Among others, your reflection might include the following lines of inquiry:

* To what extent are the values you've identified here consistent or inconsistent with other statements of values or objectives from your organization or project? Did this process confirm or conflict with your team's present understanding of its values and objectives?
* Based on your maturity test results, what gaps exist in your readiness to design and implement a data governance system? 
* What actions do you need to take to turn your work here into real governance models? Your action plan may benefit from the next two steps: stakeholder inclusion and capacity building.
 
2.   **Stakeholder inclusion.** Data governance is not something that can be limited to a particular person or siloed within a single unit. It touches everyone in a project, from front-line workers to middle-managers to final decision-makers. 
 
Any design and implementation of good data governance systems, then, must identify and meaningfully include the voices, values, and needs of all affected stakeholders. Such processes both ensure that all needs are addressed and create buy-in for the systems that will be implemented.
 
It is our hope that the results of this primer can be shared widely and used to facilitate discourse among a broad range of stakeholders. Remember: not everyone is a technology expert, or a legal expert. Think about what kind of education you may need to ensure that everyone is able to contribute meaningfully to this discussion. 
 
3.   **Capacity building.** Your organization and project stakeholders will almost certainly require some education, capacity building, and resources in order to successfully implement good data governance systems. 
 
This may seem daunting, but you can do it. One way to think about capacity-building is to identify where you can access learning and training resources. Between internal and external resources, you might find that you have more at your disposal than you expected.
 
* *Internal*. It is likely&mdash;especially with larger organizations or projects&mdash;that you can leverage internal resources: experts across your organization, from IT to compliance, itching to share their knowledge more widely.For starters, just by having completed this primer, you may be ideally suited to help collaborators and stakeholders get up to speed on data governance.
 
One easy suggestion might also be to have another project leader complete the primer separately,and compare answers. The similarities and differences you find could serve as a fruitful starting place to internal conversation and capacity-building. 
 
* External. In the end, good data governance will likely require input and assistance from external expertise. For example, to finalize the design of a data governance system, consultation with data governance professionals can be tremendously helpful, to avoid pitfalls and capture opportunities that may not be immediately obvious. And, of course, when creating a trust or forming an organization, the assistance of legal counsel is recommended. In any case, simply having done this work will make engaging with outside professionals that much easier. 

More than anything, data governance is a way of doing things: an ongoing process to ensure that your project continues to achieve its mission in an ever-changing world. We know this guide doesn't include all the answers (we don't know them), but hopefully it helped you be more knowledgeable about what questions to ask. We wish you the best of luck.
