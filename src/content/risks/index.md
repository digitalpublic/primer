Most of your time so far has been spent thinking about how your project will work&mdash;if everything goes right. Now, you'll think about what could go wrong with your project, and what you can do to mitigate or prevent those risks.

Some risks are easy to identify: a project fails to meet its objectives; an employee is phished, causing a data breach; a stakeholder misuses or inappropriately allows access to sensitive data. Other risks may be more difficult to define, or may become clearer as your project evolves.

Put another way: the risk register you build here is meant to be a beginning, not an end. As you execute your project, you'll need to revisit and revise the risks you identify, and make sure your mitigation efforts are still appropriate. 

So how do you come up with risks? One way is to think about abuses of trust: potential undesirable or harmful behavior from stakeholders and third parties connected to your project. Another is to consider potential harms to your beneficiaries that may result from your project's activities, even if the activities are a success. A third is to identify areas of uncertainty in your project: what happens if something goes wrong, or doesn't work out?

This can be an uncomfortable exercise. You and your team probably care deeply about your project, and are invested in its success. But ignoring risks won't make them less likely to occur. The time you invest now in this exercise will pay off when you're better prepared for whatever unexpected event inevitably appears on the horizon.

Once you've done this exercise, think about how the risk mitigation burden is spread across your team. Do you need to make changes to how the project is managed, or to the relationships between the project's stakeholders?
