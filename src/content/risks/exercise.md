Now, list risks to    
* the project;
* the beneficiaries (primary, not secondary stakeholders);
* the project's assets.

Use the categories above to filter, not sort. In other words, you don't need to separate each risk according to where it might apply.

For each risk, estimate its likelihood and potential severity on a scale of 1 (low) to 5 (high). List any planned or implemented mitigation measures and who is responsible for each measure.
