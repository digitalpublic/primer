Welcome to the digital governance primer, a tool to help your organization or project to better protect, manage, and gain opportunity from data.

To start, you should congratulate yourself. Just by engaging in this process you deserve some kudos. The project of data governance is of paramount importance. As digital tools play increasingly vital roles in shaping our societies, facilitating our exchanges of ideas, allocating our rights and resources, and fueling our economies, thoughtful approaches to digital governance are more critical than ever. As such, those who hold data have responsibilities to consider carefully the structures that govern its use. This primer aims to provide an early step in that process.
 
There is much to gain through thoughtful data governance. After all, data is potential. Access to quality data can support a range of business opportunities, and control of data can bring about new knowledge and insights. At the same time, data can be under-utilized, can cause inefficiencies or expense, or can even cause various harms, especially when control is lost through leak or hack. In this way, data governance is about capturing opportunity and mitigating risks.
 
As you start to work your way through this primer, there are a few key concepts you should keep in mind.
 
* First, good data governance is hard work. This primer serves to provide some direction and enhance preparedness, but it cannot suffice alone. Thoughtful data governance will necessarily entail detailed information gathering, reflection on organizational capacities, considerations of various relationships, the weighing of various risks, long-term commitment, ongoing funding, and even potential culture changes, among other arduous tasks. Data governance is not a simple project; it is an essential one.
 
* Second, data governance is neither one-size-fits-all nor a matter of finding the one perfect solution. Rather, each organization, project, or community engaging in data governance analysis will have different objectives and different characteristics that require different solutions, and each will find various data governance paths to choose.
 
* Third, data governance&mdash;even at its most thoughtful and careful&mdash;is no silver bullet. The kinds of choices offered in this primer cannot prevent data breaches or magically realize an organizationâ€™s fullest potential. They can, though, help you organize your project's goals and risks, achieve deeper trust with your constituents, and build thoughtful, sustainable governance.
