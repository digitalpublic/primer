This guide is a resource aimed at helping organizations understand and assess their progress in building applied data governance. We’re using the core elements of data trusts as the guiding framework because they provide a useful articulation of the core elements of building an effective data governance mechanism, regardless of whether organizations decide to use data trusts as the instrument.
 
## What are "Data Trusts"?
 
Here, when we use the term ‘data trust’ we are referring to the common law, legal definition of a fiduciary trust. Legal trusts are a common way for communities, networks, and groups with shared interests in property to pool and manage their assets. Legal trusts have a long history, which also means a useful set of courts, precedent, and standards to act as a practical foundation. They’re commonly used to protect shared and public land, manage pooled retirement investments, and, increasingly, to oversee the development and sharing of digital assets&mdash;like code and data. We recommend that groups consider data trusts because it gives us a foundation to build on, both in the sense that it’s an established legal infrastructure and that new contributions add to a durable, applied body of legal practice.
 
Data trusts, like any legal tool, are instruments. Their use doesn’t guarantee good governance or sustainable revenue&mdash;rather, they are an important instrument by which well-meaning actors can begin to negotiate and implement useful, repeatable processes that facilitate participation in increasingly digital decisions. We focus on the common law definition because in many legal jurisdictions, trusts are an accessible way to create fiduciary stewards over a pool of assets. Specifically, we mean trusts where:
 
>A *grantor* places an *asset* into the care of a *trustee* for a *purpose* on behalf of one or more *beneficiaries*
 
Each of these core elements raises core questions, that are essential to designing any data governance system, regardless of whether it is implemented as a legal trust. The purpose requires a group to articulate what outcome it hopes to achieve. The trustee articulates who stewards data, and how they’re chosen. Defining a trust’s beneficiaries helps organizations explain who they’re designed to serve. Identifying an asset explains what property is necessary to achieve those goals, and provides a finite boundary to a trust’s influence. These key legal elements are core to defining the foundations, expectations, and duties that underpin successful data governance.
 
Data trusts draw from property law, and appoint a legally responsible fiduciary (the trustee) to manage the underlying assets. There’s a good amount of political debate (and regional variety) on whether data is property&mdash;though the majority of the digital world already works on some form of contractually assignable right to data. Helpfully, legal scholars are [already pointing to ways](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3265315) to base data trusts on contractual data rights. We’ll talk more about that in the *Assets* section.
 
The key distinction between trusts and contracts is that trusts create stewards with fiduciary duties, and contribute to a common legal foundation.
 
## What Is A Fiduciary Duty?
 
Fiduciary duties are a way to create legally accountable responsibilities – they are often framed around loyalty and reasonable standards of care. Fiduciary duties are important because they are ways to create legal accountability, while still granting open-ended authorities. . Fiduciary duties, like trusts, come from a branch of slightly less formal branch of common law called "equity" – which is the law we typically apply during periods of great social transition. Essentially, equity courts are the system we use to settle disputes around fairness in circumstances where the letter of the law is unclear. Contracts, by contrast, typically create very specific duties – which can be ill-suited for the complexity and dynamism of data governance. A number of prominent American [academics]( https://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/49/4/Lecture/49-4_Balkin.pdf)
and [policy experts](https://www.rstreet.org/2019/05/28/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-information-fiduciaries-but-were-afraid-to-ask/) have advanced the idea of fiduciary duties as a frame for the relationship between technology platforms and users – although there are also [significant critiques](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3341661) of that approach. While there’s a significant amount of experimentation and debate to be had over the appropriate context and use of fiduciary models, their prominence from a wide range of experts and industries underlines their structural importance to digital economies.
 
Fiduciary duties are an important legal concept to the world of data governance because they create clear, articulated responsibilities and interests, with broadly construed accountability. One of the major challenges in digital collaboratives and data stewardship is building meaningfully accessible accountability – and one potential use of data trusts is to create dedicated accountability mechanisms. In addition to accountability, data trusts are often used to protect the [contextual integrity](https://crypto.stanford.edu/portia/papers/RevnissenbaumDTP31.pdf) of a digital relationship – but that can get complicated, the more varied the context.
 
Fiduciaries typically serve on individual’s, or at least very clearly aligned group, interests. That clarity is important for trustees, who are legally responsible for ensuring their decisions serve that individual or aligned group. That group, in trust terms, is the *beneficiary*. The more, and more diverse, a group of beneficiaries are, the more complicated it is to evaluate whether a trustee’s decision serves their interests. As data trusts and digital fiduciary models are increasingly applied to large-scale interests, from smart cities to healthcare research to artificial intelligence development, trustees will have to govern competing interests, within duties to loyalty and care.
 
These questions come at an opportune time – a number of the leading fiduciary law scholars have turned toward applying fiduciary frameworks and philosophies to foundational governance institutions. In other words, legal scholars are increasingly making the argument for applied, fiduciary governance. At a fundamental level, the reusability of data raises significant questions around how beneficiaries to a data trust are defined, and how trustees might manage the potential for conflicts of interest and duties.
 
That’s where data governance comes in. Data governance is the act of balancing competing interests over the life cycle of data.
 
## Civic Data Trusts and Governance
 
Civic data trusts are a subset of data trusts that, instead of appointing a single trustee, appoint a multi-stakeholder governance mechanism to oversee and execute the core functions of the trust. Civic Data Trusts draw on the English model of civic trusts, which predominantly oversee the administration of shared lands. Similar to the way that data trusts build on traditional models and apply them to digital relationships, civic data trusts apply the standards, tools, and structural approaches to digital assets. Civic Data Trusts apply fiduciary law theory to the institutions and structures of governance.
 
The reason to highlight the role of ‘civic’ in designing the governance of a data trust is to explain participation models and conflicting interests as important, if not determinative, characteristics of their success. That often means identifying a potentially wide range, and changing cast, of stakeholders whose interests may start with the provenance of the underlying data, may come from the role in the treatment of that data, or may arise because of the use of data, among others. Each of these stakeholder interests sets may require dedicated, or even different, approaches to governance – and one indicator of an effective data governance design is its ability to sustain operations and participation amidst competing interests. For the purpose of this primer, the distinction between civic data trusts and data trusts is most useful to highlight the opportunity for flexibility, experimentation, and governance in the design of the *Trustee*.
 
## How to use data trusts as a design framework
 
This guide is designed to help you work through the key elements of designing a data governance system, as required by data trusts. We’ve broken each core element of a data trust into a standalone section which explains:
 
* what each element is;
* a few ways to productively understand its role – including core concepts, issues, and development activities; and
* a (soon to be) interactive assessment tool to help you understand your readiness to design a data governance system.
