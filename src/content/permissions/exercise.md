*This exercise will see users build a permissions table. A prose description of the exercise follows. It will be converted into an interactive soon.*

For each stakeholder, list the actions that they are:    
* permitted to take without any conditions (e.g., a project manager might be able to freely query data in a database)
* only permitted to take if certain conditions are met (e.g., board approval). List conditions.
* prohibited to take

You need not list every possible action that a stakeholder could take, but at least make sure the activities you listed in the previous section are addressed in some way.
