Much of your data project's day-to-day operation comes down to permissions: who can do what, when, and how.

Good governance will require you to not only spell out these permissions in advance, but also build a process for managing and monitoring use of your project’s data and other assets. You’ll also need to come up with a way to handle potential uses of data that you haven’t specified in advance.

This may seem daunting, but you can handle it. An easy way to start is to build a permissions table: a list of permitted and prohibited uses, along with uses that require additional conditions: a rate-limited query, or permission from a data subject.

A template for a basic one is on the next page. We've added a few complications that might be helpful.

But you need more than just a list. It may be impossible to fully predict all the many ways your project's data could be used. Novel uses could arise with new data. New opportunities and partnerships could require new permissions. An organization could get reshuffled. A project's needs could change. A potential use may not fit neatly into a category you've listed, or it may cover multiple categories. Someone may need to decide that a use belongs in a certain category.

Even in the moment, a permissions table needs a process for checking, approving, and rejecting internal and external requests, and people responsible for each. Those requests need to be monitored and managed. 

In other words, the permissions table should be a starting point, but not an ending point. As your project evolves, you'll need to build principles and processes for accessing data, to help manage the routine and the unexpected.
