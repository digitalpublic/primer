Assets are things that make your project go.

An asset can be digital. (If you're here, your project almost certainly has digital assets.) An asset can be a dataset, a model, a document—any thing you can identify and connect to your project. 

Assets can come from your organization or from someone else. For example, your project might rely on a publicly available data standard, or a piece of software produced by a third party. You might collect data from your members via a survey.

An asset can also be a right to do something. For example, you could have the right to run a particular query a specific database. It may be that that's all you need to run part of your project, rather than access to an entire (sensitive) database.

Over time, your project's activities will change your asset inventory: you'll collect new data, procure new software, use data standards, and develop models from the data you've collected. Your project's governance will in part come from how you manage these assets—from sourcing and collecting data to deciding who can and can't use it. 

On the next page, you'll inventory your project's assets—what you have, what you need—and connect them to your activities. Explicitly making these connections will help focus your project on the assets it needs to run, while minimizing extraneous data collection.
