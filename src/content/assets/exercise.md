*This exercise will prompt users to identify the assets they need to fulfill each of the activities they listed in the "purpose" exercise. A prose description of the exercise follows. It will be converted to an exercise soon.*


Inventory the project's assets. 

An asset can be physical or digital (or financial). An asset can be a document, a dataset, a model. It can even be the right to access something--for instance, the right to query a third-party database.

Organize this inventory around the project's activities: for each activity, list assets that:
* you use to perform the activity (inputs you have)
* you need but don't yet have to perform the activity (inputs you need)
* the activity produces (outputs)
